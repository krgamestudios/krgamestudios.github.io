Hello World! I'm Kayne Ruse, an independent game developer, making both video and tabletop games of all kinds.

I've been making games for 20 years, and was born with a controller in my hand. I've got a lot of practical skills and hands-on experience with my own projects, but no formal work history to match, due to a variety of reasons.

One of my biggest claims to fame is releasing a game on the Nintendo Switch - [Candy Raid: The Factory](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/candy-raid-the-factory-switch/).

Another would be spending four and a half years on a microservice driven web game, and actually *completing it* - [Egg Trainer](https://eggtrainer.com/). Egg Trainer is currently undergoing a full sale and transfer of it's IP, as I'm ready to move on to the next stage of my life.

My ultimate goal in life is to lead my own gamedev team on self-sustaining projects - that is, our success and sales can support us well enough to carry us between releases.
