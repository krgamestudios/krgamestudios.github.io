title: "Stepwise: Gates of Yendor"
---

Step forward, mortal! You, who have trespassed upon this forbidden ground, are now bound to this place! If you wish to ever return to your pitiful realm, you must obtain the fabled Amulet of Yendor, for only then shall the gates open once more! But be warned, within these halls are terrible beasts and ancient horrors - things that are best left undisturbed, for their time of awakening, is not yet at hand.

**Stepwise: Gates of Yendor** is a traditional roguelike dungeon crawler with state-of-the-art 80s ASCII graphics, smooth and intuitive controls, and a diverse set of environments with powerful and intimidating monsters from a bygone era!

Currently in active development, **Stepwise: Gates of Yendor** will release in early 2026.
