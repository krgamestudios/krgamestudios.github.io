**Stepwise: Gates of Yendor** is a traditional roguelike dungeon crawler with retro-inspired graphics, currently in active development, with a projected release date in early 2026.

The scope of this game has been greatly reduced for practical reasons, so a proper description is MIA for now - Sorry!
