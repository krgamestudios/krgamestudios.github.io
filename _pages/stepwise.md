title: "Stepwise"
---

Stepwise (working title) is a traditional roguelike, with console-like graphics, built with [python-tcod](https://github.com/libtcod/python-tcod). Stepwise is still under heavy development, and is not yet ready for release.

Each time you start a run, a genre is chosen from a predefined list of Worlds. Which world is chosen will dictate the rules for that run, altering the map generation and overall goals. Some talking monsters may change their dialog, or some monsters may only spawn in some worlds but not others.

Some recurring elements will exist in all worlds to provide some stability, but will often be warped to fit - for example, if the "fantasy" world has Cid, the Dwarven shopkeeper, the "sci-fi" world has C.I.D., the Customer Inventory Droid.
