**Stepwise: Gates of Yendor** is a traditional roguelike dungeon crawler with retro-inspired graphics, currently in active development, with a projected release date in early 2026.

The scope of this game has been greatly reduced for practical reasons, so a proper description is MIA for now - Sorry!

### Known Bugs

* [Fixed] 'Start Again' was reusing the same seed (restart the program for a new seed)
* [Fixed] Custom seed menu is not accepting any text input (caused by underlying tech upgrades)
* [Fixed] Added help state to the game over state
* `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar add` (needs a closer look, doesn't seem to cause problems)
* Monsters can spawn on the same tile as the player when a room lacks enough space (mostly on floors 3 & 4)
