This page contains an ever evolving list of interesting TCG design considerations, in no particular order. I feel like I'll end up making a TCG at some point, so getting these down in writing is a good start.

<!--more-->

## Meta

* Themes, top-down or bottom-up design
* Are TCGs treated differently than other games?
* Why do TCGs have perpetual lifespans? 
* Cobbling together mechanics vs being different for the sake of it
* Different kinds of wincons can set you apart:
	* Exodia-style "assemble the pieces"
	* Having 5 more of a certain resource than your opponent
	* A shared central "tower" that you fight to control
* Digital vs physical divide allowing different mechanics
	* upgrading or dusting
	* Tracking with tapped or untapped cards
	* steps and phases

## Production

* Booster pack contents
* Rarities and complexity
* Sets & rotation
* Alternative methods of distribution (PnP, PoD, etc.)

## Onboarding

* Intro products & follow ups
* limiting cognitive load

## Gameplay

* Game length
* Win condition
* 1st turn advantage
* How to play
* Staple cards & Archetypes
* Momentum vs disruption
* Rulebooks
* Updates, errata & banlists
* Formats & rotations
* Resource systems
* Tributing monsters for bigger monsters
* Does combat favour the defender (magic) or the attacker(yugioh)?
* Factions/Colors/Archetypes

## Game Idea: The Art Of War

By drawing on themes from this classical book, a basis for gameplay can be established: Make your opponent expend resources faster than you. So, when your resources reach zero, it's game over. Each card you play might consume some amount of resources, but attacking your opponent also reduces their resources.

At the start of the game, you begin with 1000 "Silver", and each card you play may consume some amount of this Silver[^2]. Only one "unit" can be played each turn, but any number of "tactic" cards can be played, and "stratagem" cards can be placed face down for use during your opponent's turn. Units will attack to reduce the opponent's Silver, and tactics are used during your own turn, but stratagems are used only during your opponent's turn.

Each card on the field represents some kind of investment into the board state, so each card lost is a major blow. The exact details of the card can come later, but a match is played as best-of-three, with "40+15 max 3" decks. I'm not sure what the exact turn sequence would look like, and different options need to be tested.

Here's some basic example cards:

| Name | Type | C/A/D | Effect | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bear | Unit - Bear Soldier | 20/20/20 | ... | *"They have the right to keep and what??" -Corporal Wojtek* |
| There | Tactic | 20 | Destroy one target Unit. | *"There was a bear in there..."* |
| AWOL | Stratagem | 20[^1] | Exile one target unit you control. Return it to the field under its owner's control at the end of this turn. | *"...and a chair as well!"* |

[^1]: Stratagems would cost the same amount to place face-down regardless of effect.
[^2]: If all cards are paid with silver, where do factions and other deckbuilding restrictions come from? Could a Star Realms style mechanic work?
