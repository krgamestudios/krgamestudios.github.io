I can't look at Power Rangers the same anymore. That might seem weird, but as a kid I LOVED power rangers - to this day my mother hates Power Rangers (and Pokemon), because I was so obsessed with them.

To me, Tommy Oliver was the very definition of cool.

Jason David Frank, who played Tommy Oliver, died by suicide in 2022 after suffering from depression and other mental issues. Looking back at those old shows and movies, knowing what's coming for that young actor... I just can't look at it the same.

It's weird... I've suffered through depression for a big chunk of my 20s, but I can't remember a lot of it very easy. I do remember that I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for my brother. So yeah, I've been there, in JDF's shoes... I just can't look at it the same.

JDF's final project, "Legend of the White Dragon", looks genuinely good, like something genuinely creative and new, that could spark a whole...

I'm alive. I'm still here - greatly changed, but I can proudly say that my depression issues are under control, and I'm looking forward to the future for the first time in my life. I still break into tears thinking about things like this, which is only natural. My heart still bleeds for those who couldn't make it. I didn't do it alone - I had so many people helping me in one way or another - but it *is* possible.

It's a very long and painful journey, and asking for help is only the beginning. But it *is* possible for things to get better, I'm living proof of that. I hope one day, I can help someone the way so many people helped me.

I suppose, I want to be someone's definition of cool.
