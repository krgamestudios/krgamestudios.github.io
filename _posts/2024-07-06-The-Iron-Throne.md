OK, first: Unless you have personally gone from what amounts to a torture device, to a brand new (albeit second-hand) office chair which is actually comfortable to sit in, you can't imagine the bliss I'm experiencing right now. I've had that "gaming chair" for about 10 years now, and it must've counted as an OHSA violation from the get-go.

Fair to say, despite being awake at 6am, I'm in a good mood.

Now, to the topic at hand: In about 2 hours, a game jam will begin, called [The Game Wisdom Game Jam Volume 4](https://itch.io/jam/the-game-wisdom-game-jam-volume-4) - I've been looking forward to joining this one, as it's run by a (relatively) small-time YouTuber, who's managed to cultivate a good little community. The only major problem I can foresee is that the past themes have been... less than ideal - either too specific, or not open enough to work with.

It'll be good for me to finish a game, after spending so much time wrapping up Egg Trainer for sale - I think we might finally be getting close there, but without a solid end date, it's hard to say.

A jam - even a 9 day one like this one - gives me a solid goal to work towards. I'll be spending most of my free time this weekend on the jam, and I'll still have Pupper and Egg Trainer to tinker on if I get bogged down here.

I'll probably append this post later today with more thoughts on the theme, and how I could approach it - I know it's going to be using Godot, but I may need to grab a decent spriting tool as well. As for music... yes?

BTW, since I'm on a raspberry pi, the resulting game will almost certainly be web-based, so downloading a binary won't be required.
