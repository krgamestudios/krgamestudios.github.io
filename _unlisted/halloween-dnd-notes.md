# 2025 Halloween one-shot

These notes are rough, but more than enough for me to work with.

This is for a party of level six characters.

## 5-room-dungeon:

A: Travel to a dreary town  
B: Social encounter at a gallows  
C: Combat during a prison riot  
D: Chase through the sewers  
E: Combat at desecrated church/mosoleum  

## Details

You arrive in a dark and dreary town, people seem to be scared of their own shadows and cursing the gallows in the town square.

Traditionally, executions can only occur during a new moon, but the latest attempt hasn't killed the condemned. Five undying criminals are hanging from the necks:

* Joker with gallows humor
* Unremorseful bastard
* Only stole to feed his family
* Scapegoat for an unrelated burglary
* Former associate of the cultist

Ofter talking to the cultist's associate, who sold them matierials for a strange ritual. Some of the materials were illegal, which is why they're hanging. They will point the party towards a prison on the outskirts of town.

The prison, now full of criminals with no fear of death, is in a riot. The guards have barricaded the exits, but the warden is trapped inside. The guards request the players to find the warden and aid him if needed. The warden points the party to the cultist's location, but when they find him, he'll disappear down a newly dug hole into the sewers.

For the chase scene through the sewers, each ability check will alter the final boss's strength. If there's three or more players, two successes is a pass, otherwise only one is needed. The checks are:

1. Determine which direction he ran
2. Follow without tripping or falling into the muck or losing sight of the cultist
3. Skeletal hands reach down from the sewer ceiling to grapple you
4. The cultist will throw several Wicked Daggers at the party
5. The cultist slips into a hidden entryway, the players need to follow

When the players finally arrive at the altar, the cultist will succeed in summoning their master - the psychopomp, who promptly consumes the cultist and engages the players. A grimoire used by the cultist sits open, with clear instructions for calling upon dieties, and states that to vanquish the psychopomp, the players need to remove them from the altar and summon the god of death, who will instruct the players to move the psychopomp back to the altar, putting them within the god's reach.
