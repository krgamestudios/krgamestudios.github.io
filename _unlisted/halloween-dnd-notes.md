# 2025 Halloween one-shot

These notes are rough, but more than enough for me to work with.

## 5-room-dungeon:

A: Travel to a dreary town  
B: Social encounter at a gallows  
C: Combat during a prison riot  
D: Chase through the sewers  
E: Combat at desecrated church/mosoleum  

## Details

```
You arrive in a dark and dreary town, people seem to be scared of their own
shadows and cursing the gallows in the central square

Executions can only occur during a new moon
The latest executions haven't killed the condemned
Five condemned criminals hanging from the necks
    * Joker with gallows humor
    * Unremorseful bastard
    * Only stole to feed his family
    * Scapegoat
    * Former associate of the cultist

Cultist's Associate:
    * TODO: detail me (sold materials for the ritual, including illegal stuff?)

Prison full of undying criminals:
    Guards enlist the players to find the warden
    Warden trapped in a cell points them at the cultist as the culprit
    Confront the cultist, which will make him escape down a hole
    TODO: outline the prison layout

Give chase, through the sewers:
    * Each success in the chase determines the final boss's strengths
    * If playerCount >= 4, 2 passes is a success, else 1 pass is a success

    1. Determine which direction he ran
    2. Follow fast without tripping or falling into the muck or getting lost
    3. You can see them in the distance, now what?
    4. Skeletal hands reach down from the sewer ceiling to grapple you, now what?
    5. They slips through a hidden passage into the altar room, now what?

When he reaches the final altar, the boss will appear (summoned), eat the
cultist, and engage the players

```

## Stat Blocks

```
