It's been just over four months since I began [Toy](https://github.com/Ratstail91/Toy)'s rewrite in ernest, and I've outlined a rough schedule for the next three-ish months. At that point, I'll begin building an engine around it.

A friend of mine is working towards building tools and utilities within Unity, to support a game of his own. Since game engines seem to be on my mind this week, lets begin outlining the Box engine, which will be the next step for Toy.
