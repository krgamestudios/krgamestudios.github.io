title: "Miniature Discourse"
---

A YouTuber I follow who goes by [Discourse Minis](https://www.youtube.com/c/DiscourseMiniatures), who discusses miniature wargaming (and related drama), released her first commercial game called [Little Big War](https://www.wargamevault.com/en/product/539624/little-big-war). I bought it to see what it was like and, to put it bluntly, it's not very good and filled with issues. So, I want to take this opportunity to dive into this game, to dissect this person's first efforts as a game designer, and offer critique and advice for any newbies who are interested in making their own games. This will cover both the design and ruleset of Little Big War, as well as the physical layout and readability of the PDF hosted on Wargame Vault.

A quick note: Discourse has another game called "Blood Black" available to her Patreon supporters, but as this is her first purely *commercial* game, I won't be looking at it.

## Price and Product

When designing a commercial game, it can be difficult to choose an appropriate price for the time and effort you put in. Little Big War (or LBW for short) is listed at $4.89 USD, and I paid $7.83 AUD thanks to the exchange rates. This price range is fairly common for indie titles, though I find some designers are selling themselves short with their prices.

For LBW, I don't think it's purchasing in its current state for any price point, especially considering it's only 13 pages long, with multiple (high-quality) illustrations and photographs of miniatures that seem to be custom-designed for this game, though I could be mistaken. If you omit the copyright info, credits and aknowledgements, there's just over 3300 words in the document. While it's not impossible to deliver a great game in so few words, it's worth knowing what you're in for.
