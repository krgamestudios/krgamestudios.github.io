I have an odd personality - that's not a good or bad thing, it's just an observation. When I find something that interests me, I can become quite obsessive about it - in fact, at its worst, I can feel compelled to work on something for way too long, leaving myself zombiefied by the end.

It might sound surprising that I worked for 14 hours straight in one day - but considering that that came at the end of about a week of 6+ hour sessions, it's downright alarming.
