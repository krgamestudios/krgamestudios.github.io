If you see a big hole in the ground, you want to know what's at the bottom, right? If you see a big mountain, naturally you want to climb it.

What drives you to do that? Mere curiosity? A sense of adventure? Or is there something more?

I wonder what drives me to make games. My current idea, after such a long project, is something relatively small: a tabletop roleplaying game titled [Curses and Blessings](https://gitea.krgamestudios.com/Ratstail91/curses-and-blessings).

This game initially began as a fan-made TTRPG set in the world of Made in Abyss, my favourite manga and anime (Warning: Dark Themes). After the first play test, I gave it a good long think, and realized that I actually don't want to be tied to the MIA world, despite loving it so much.

So, I took the mechanics I had outlined, scrapped the setting, and created a new setting by effectively tracing around the outline of the abyss. In some areas there's a 1-to-1 correlation of elements, but as I develop the game I plan on expanding into new directions that I couldn't have before.

**Tier, the Sacred Mountain** - a massive mountain that seems to unexpectedly jut up from the otherwise mostly flat continent - different altitudes are divided roughly into seven "tiers" (yes, the name maybe confusing), with the topmost tiers being a mysterious point of no return.

This is pretty close to the structure of the Abyss - 7 layers and a point of no return - but I'm already beginning to think of ways to differentiate it. For example, the 3rd tier has a series of holes in a sheer cliff face (much like the abyss), but I'm turning them into nests for large birds called fortner (drawn from the Corspe Weepers, but without their distinctive traits).
