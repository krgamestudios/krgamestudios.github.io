Nintendo's Pokemon is the world's biggest multimedia franchise, and is recognizable across the world - even my 3yo cousin recognizes Pikachu by name. However, it all started with a pair of games, Pokemon Red Version and Pokemon Green Version, with an updated Pokemon Blue Version releasing later (Blue would become the basis for the international releases). These games laid the groundwork for the decades to come, but they were also riddled with bugs and strange oddities. Today, despite their significance, and their impact on so many people, I do feel like the most changes that have been made since then are for the better.

In this post, I want to take a closer look at one change in particular, the 'special' stat and its development, and I want to consider the impact this had on the game as a whole.

## Generation I

First, I should mention that the moves used by Pokemon in battle are separated into three Categories: Physical, Special and Status. Physical moves direct attacks, such as Quick Attack, that use the Pokemon's body. Special moves, like Flamethrower, tend to use a Pokemon's inherent powers. Status moves don't deal direct damage, instead altering the battle in some way. Each move also has a Type, which uses the Type Chart to alter the amount of damage dealt to the targets.

When Pokemon Red & Blue were released, each Pokemon had five stats that were used in combat: HP, Attack, Defense, Special and Speed. HP is the amount of damage the Pokemon could take before feinting, and Speed determines who moves first each turn. Attack is used to determine the damage dealt by physical moves, and defense determines how much to reduce that damage by on a hit.

The special stat, on the other hand, acts as the determining stat when attacking with and defending against a special move. Prior to Generation IV, the Category of a move was dependent on its Type:

Physical: Normal, Fighting, Flying, Poison, Ground, Rock, Bug, Ghost, *Steel  
Special: Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, Psychic, Ice, Dragon, *Dark  

**Dark and Steel weren't added until Generation II, but they still followed these rules.*

I find it quite interesting that, during the franchise's early years, the fundamentals of battle were so extremely different from today's system. I could definitely envision a world were the mechanics' developed along a different path, and the special stat was still considered a kind of wildcard, that set it apart from the physical category, rather than a copy/pasted mechanic with different values.
