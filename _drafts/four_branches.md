TODO: improve this excerpt.

People talk about AAA and indie games like they're the only two kinds of game that exist. There seems to be this arbitrary designation as to what game falls into what category, usually based on what publishers they come from, as this often impacts the kinds of games you see. I'm not so sure, and I'm starting to think there may be four (or more) of these arbitrary categories, so let's break it down, with examples.

<!--more-->

In 2022, Blizzard Entertainment had about 13,000 employees[^1], placing it firmly in the first branch of AAA studios.

In 2020, Ninja Theory had 120 employees[^2], placing it in the second branch of AA studios (*Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice* was released prior to their 2018 acquisition by the gray goo of Microsoft, so I'm counting it here).

As of 2024, Kitfox Games has 12 employees[^3], despite having published the immensely influential *Dwarf Fortress* and the Hugo Award Winning *Caves of Qud* (and *Boyfriend Dungeon*? I may or may not need to play that eventually), landing it squarely in the single-A branch.

As of this year, KR Game Studios consists of one person[^4] that can't seem to focus on the game that is ostensibly planned to release in about six months, landing it squarely in the L branch.

TODO: talk about small-scale bedroom developers, Counter Strike Skiing, etc.
