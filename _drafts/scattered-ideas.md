title: Draw Two Cards
---

I recently wrote down a dozen-ish game mechanics from various places that I find interesting in isolation. These ideas work well in their respective games, but could also be adapted or reused in other games. Since half of them were related to card games in some way, I've picked those specific mechanics to talk about, as they share a common genre.

## Prize Cards

The Pokémon Trading Card Game first released in January 1996 in Japan (1999 in English) with Base Set, based on the wildly popular video games Pokémon Red & Green (which were adapted as Red & Blue in English). It would take an additional two sets (Jungle and Fossil) before all 151 Pokémon had their own card, and many players consider these sets to be immensely fun to play.

While other trading card games predated the Pokémon TCG (most notably Magic: The Gathering), most of the gameplay elements were drawn from the video games. In the video games, each player can carry at most six Pokémon at a time, and once you've knocked out all of your opponent's Pokémon, then you've won the battle.

The TCG mimics this goal by having prize cards - once your initial active and benched Pokémon are chosen, the top six cards from your deck are set aside, becoming your prize cards. One of these prize cards is placed into your hand each time you knock out an opponent's Pokémon. Once all six prize cards have been taken, you win the game.

This clever mechanic is pulling triple duty - they mark a player's progression towards the end-game, they slow-drip rewards to the player for each successful knock-out, and they also remove a full 10% of a player's 60 card deck, which introduces a degree of complication to both deck building and gameplay.

As a rule of thumb, when I build a deck in the modern TCG, I add one more copy of any card than I want to see during play - so, if I presumably want two copies of 'Iono' in an average game, then I'll include three in the deck list. Similarly, while it's unlikely that both copies of Boss's Orders will be prized, the chances are not zero, and when it happens, I need to adapt on the fly to the absence of such an important card.

There is one notable drawback to this system, which any regular player is familiar with - knocking out an opponent's Pokémon often means you're pulling ahead of your opponent, and receiving a prize card as a reward means the game's core rules have a slight 'win-more' aspect to them. This isn't inherently a bad thing, and these days it's often used as an element of risk-vs-reward (e.g. the recent 'Charizard ex' has an attack which becomes more powerful the more prizes your opponent has taken), but the choice to use a similar system should take this drawback into consideration.

## Shield Cards

The Duel Masters Trading Card Game first released May 2002 in Japan (2004 in the US), and later rebranded internationally as 'Kaijudo: Rise of the Duel Masters' in 2012. It's currently only sold in Japan, where it's apparently really popular. I'm just going to call it 'Duel Masters' for brevity.

I've never actually played this game, but here's the gist of it - Duel Masters is Magic: The Gathering with bad anime hair. That's not a totally inaccurate description, as it was developed as a direct alternative to MtG for the Japanese market, with some elements of gameplay simplified (any card can be played as a resource, rather than requiring dedicated land cards), while also retaining other core elements (the five 'civilizations' match the five colors of MtG).

One such element that was simplified was life points - rather than needing to reduce your opponent's life total to zero, Duel Monsters adapts the prize card system from Pokémon TCG, but adapts it into shield cards. Much like Pokémon, shield cards are removed from your deck and act as a progress tracker, but instead of taking one as a prize, when an opponent is attacked directly, that defender is the one who takes a shield card into their hand. Each player starts with 5 shield cards, and they lose the game if they're attacked without a shield to deflect the damage.

This is a brilliant twist, as it adds an element of catch-up to the core rules of the game, and also creates design space for 'trigger' effects, which activate when a shield card is broken. While other aspects of Duel Masters simply makes me want to play MtG instead, this particular element is something that I'd love to use myself one day.
