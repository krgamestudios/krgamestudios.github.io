Hello world!

Time for a new wepage theme - this time, brought to you by GitHub Pages!

Here's a quick list of my current and past projects until I get things in order here:

* [The Toy Programming Language](https://toylang.com)
* [Egg Trainer](https://eggtrainer.com)
* [MERN-template](https://github.com/krgamestudios/MERN-template)
* [Candy Raid: The Factory](https://candyraid.com)
* [Potion School](https://www.drivethrucards.com/product/305213/Potion-School)
* [Fiends, Foils & Fallen](https://www.wargamevault.com/product/398072/Fiends-Foils--Fallen)
* [sineQL](https://github.com/Ratstail91/sineQL)

Each of these will receive their own pages on this site very soon.
