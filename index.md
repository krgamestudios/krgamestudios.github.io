Hello World! I'm Kayne Ruse, an independent game developer, making both video and tabletop games of all kinds.

I've been making games since I was a kid (20 years now!), and I plan to keep going, no matter what. I've worked with several small ad-hoc teams over the years, and I've always made games with minimal budgets - hence my motto: **Making games on a shoestring budget**.

If you want to contact me, you can do so at [krgamestudios@gmail.com](mailto:krgamestudios@gmail.com)
